# Overview

## Introduction
The NocoBase data visualization plugin provides visual data querying and a rich set of chart components. With simple configuration, you can quickly build dashboards, present insights, and support multi‑dimensional analysis and display.

## Key concepts
- Chart block: A chart component in the page that supports data query, chart configuration, and interaction events.
- Data query modes: Builder (visual configuration) and SQL (handwritten SQL).
- Data preview: Run queries anytime in the configuration panel and view results as table or JSON.
- Chart configuration modes: Basic (visual configuration) and custom (write JS that returns a chart options object).
- Interaction events: Bind events to charts (for example, click to open a new view for drill‑down analysis) implemented with JS.

## Installation
Data visualization is a built‑in NocoBase plugin. It works out of the box and requires no separate installation.
