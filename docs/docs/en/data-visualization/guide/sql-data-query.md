# Query data in SQL mode

In the Data query panel, switch to SQL mode, write and run the query, and use the returned result directly for chart mapping and rendering.

## Write SQL statements
- In the Data query panel, choose SQL mode.
- Enter SQL and click Run query.
- Supports complex statements including multi‑table JOIN and VIEW.

Example: order amount by month
```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as mon,
  SUM(total_amount) AS total
FROM "order"
GROUP BY mon
ORDER BY mon ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

## View results
- Click View data to open the preview panel.

Data supports pagination; you can switch between Table and JSON to check column names and types.

## Field mapping
- In Chart options, map fields based on the query result columns.
- By default, the first column is used as the dimension (X axis or category), and the second column as the measure (Y axis or value). Mind the column order in SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as mon, -- dimension field in the first column
  SUM(total_amount) AS total -- measure field afterwards
```

## Use context variables
Click the x button at the top‑right of the SQL editor to choose context variables.

After confirming, the variable expression is inserted at the cursor (or replaces the selected text).

For example, `{{ ctx.user.createdAt }}`. Do not add extra quotes.

Recommendations:
- Stabilize column names before mapping to charts to avoid errors later.
- During debugging, set `LIMIT` to reduce returned rows and speed up preview.

## Preview, save, and rollback
- Click Run query to request data and refresh the chart preview.
- Click Save to persist the current SQL text and related configuration to the database.
- Click Cancel to revert to the last saved state and discard current unsaved changes.
